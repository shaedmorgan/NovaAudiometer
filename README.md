# NovaAudiometer
This audiometer app is used to be able to calibrate and open-source diagnostic hearing testing to expand access to hearing healthcare services around the world. 

The app must first be calibrated using a sound level meter. In the Calibration section, play each tone at each frequency using your selected transducer and device. We recommend defaulting to iOS (iPhone or iPad) and using the HDA280 Pro headphones (Sennheiser). This inexpensive setup allows anyone to create a diagnostic-quality hearing test setup.

Play each tone and measure the output. Enter the measured output into the app and save each value. 
Check your calibration - go to screening or diagnostic and present a tone at a target frequency. The measured value in the SLM should match the dB HL + the RETSPL for that transducer. If not, you can adjust the settings and re-calibrate
